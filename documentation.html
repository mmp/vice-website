					      <p><i>Vice</i> is a new (potential) client for <a href="https://vatsim.net">VATSIM</a>, the virtual online aviation network.
                                                It is an all-new client implementation, features support for both Windows and Mac computers, and offers a wide range of
                                                useful features for virtual air traffic control.</p>
                                              <p>
                                                At the moment <i>vice</i> is best described as a fairly-complete prototype; although it supports the vast majority of features
                                                necessary for a control client, it is still missing a few features&mdash;an example is flight strips, which haven't
                                                yet been implemented.  More significantly, <i>vice</i> is not yet able to connect to the VATSIM network; even if it
                                                was fully-featured, it cannot be used for ATC until it can connect to VATSIM! (This is a state of affairs that I
                                                hope will change in the future.) Nevertheless, it's possible to give <i>vice</i> a try, using air traffic from
                                                <a href="https://www.flightradar24.com">Flightradar24</a> or by capturing the network traffic from a VATSIM session;
                                                this topic is discussed further in <a href="#traffic">Traffic Sources</a>.
                                                </p>

				    <section class="docs-section" id="goals">
						<h2 class="section-heading">Goals</h2>
						<p>It's fair to ask, why another VATSIM client? The <i>vice</i> project started out of curiousity with an interest
                                                  in trying out some new ideas for how a client might work.
                                                  I asked myself "how hard could it be?", and as always seems to be the case, the answer to that question was "much harder
                                                  than it seemed at first."
                                                  Nevertheless, once you get far enough with something like this, your choice is to finish it or throw it away, incomplete.
                                                  Not wanting to the effort to go to waste, I went with finishing it.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>A few further motivations became clear as I made progress.  The first was <b>cross-platform support</b>: the ability to use VATSIM on non-Windows computers (both Macs and Linux) is of interest to many; <i>vice</i> was therefore written to be cross-platfrom from the start.
                                                  The next was that it be <b>open source</b>: the source code to <i>vice</i> is freely available; my hope is that it will see further improvements thanks to the contributions of additional developers.</p>
                                                <p>
                                                  In its current form, </i>vice</i> does not strive to replicate the experience of using a particular real-world ATC system.
Rather, its goal is to be general-purpose and to be suited to VATSIM's unique top-down control structure, where a controller may be simultaneously responsible for a range of positions.
An interesting future project would be to add modes that better replicate specific real-world systems; much of the core of <i>vice</i>'s implementation could be reused for such an effort, making it easier to develop such support. 
                                                  </p>

						<h2 class="section-heading">Credits</h2>
						<p>
<i>vice</i> uses a number of open-source libraries in its implementation; see the <a href="https://github.com/mmp/vatce/blob/master/CREDITS.txt">credits file</a> in the source code distribution for details.
Thanks also to the font and audio designers whose freely-available work is used in <i>vice</i>; they, too, are listed in the credits file.
Finally, thanks to our AI overlord <a href="https://openai.com/dall-e-2/">DALL-E 2</a>, who created <i>vice</i>'s icon given the prompt "air traffic control tower retro art deco".
</p>

<p>
  <i>vice</i> is heavily influenced by Ross Carlson's <a href="https://vrc.rosscarlson.dev">VRC</a> client for VATSIM; many features from VRC have been reimplemented in <i>vice</i>.
  Thanks to Ross for many happy hours with VRC as well as the inspiration for those features.

                                                <p>As a new client, <i>vice</i> will inevitably have bugs. If you have encountered one, apologies!
                                                  It would be of great help if you would send in a report if <i>vice</i> crashes when you're using it,
                                                  reports an error that it cannot recover from, or even if it is doing something that doesn't seem quite
                                                  right.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>Bugs can be reported via email at <i>bugs@vice.pharr.org</i>. In your bug report, please include:
                                                  <ol>
                                                    <li>A description of what you were doing and how <i>vice</i> responded. If what it's drawing on the

                                                    <li><i>Vice</i>'s log files from your controlling session; after you exit <i>Vice</i>, it will save a log
                                                      file for your session. On Windows, it's in your <code>AppData</code> folder in <code>Roaming/Vice/vice.log</code> and on Mac, it's in <code>Library/Application Support/Vice/vice.log</code>. Attaching that file to a bug report will greatly help with fixing the issue. Note that this file is overwritten each time you quit <i>vice</i>, so be sure not restart <i>vice</i> before attaching it to a bug report and sending the email. </li>

						<p>The Airport Information subwindow can be used to display a variety of information about one or more airports.
                                                  Which airports are covered by an Airport Information subwindow can be entered in its settings window.
                                                  Each of the following can be included in the information displayed, again determined by the subwindow's settings.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>The current time and the weather for the selected airports. (Here, only KPHL is selected.)
                                                  The altimeter and winds are highlighted, for ease of finding them quickly.

                                                  In this way, when a pilot first connects, it's easy to quickly see if their flight plan has problems.
                                                  ("Uncleared" is currently determined using the heuristic that aircraft without assigned squawk codes are assumed to be uncleared.)

                                                  The information included is tailored to the needs of ground and tower controllers, including aircraft type

                                                  Here the second aircraft has an indicator that shows that it is not squawking mode Charlie.
                                                  Aircraft that are squawking a code other than their assigned code are also flagged here.

                                                  Here, the cleared altitude is shown first and the aircraft's current altitude is shown afterward.
                                                  The scratchpad is shown between the aircraft type and the cleared altitude.
                                                  In this case, both aircraft have empty scratchpads.

                                                  Next is the aircraft's temporary altitude, if set, followed by its altitude.
                                                  Its distance to the airport is shown last.
                                                  Note that arrivals are not sorted strictly by their distance to the airport; an aircraft 10,000 feet directly above the field may be assumed to be arriving later than one 6nm away at 2,000 feet.
                                                  The sorting of arrivals attempts to display them in the order in which they will reach the airport, given these considerations.

                                                  From its configuration dialog box on the right, we can see that the headings for runway 13 with 13L ILS are at hand but are not displayed; in this way it's possible to have a number of possibly-relevant quickly available but not necessarily dispayed.

                                                      that functionality will come in a future release.
                                                      Therefore, it may seem that using the command-line interface will be unweildy and will require much typing.
                                                      User-configurable aliases and function key bindings will greatly reduce the typing load,
                                                      making it easy to use familiar bindings like selecting an aircraft and hitting F3 to initiate a track.

					      <p>Most of a controller's actions controlling aircraft in <i>vice</i> are done via typing commands;
                                                the mouse is usually only used for interacting with the scope and selecting aircraft.
                                                A <i>vice</i> Config will almost always include a Command-line Interface (CLI) subwindow, which allows entering commands
                                                and seeing their results.
                                                (Recall the earlier discussion of <a href="#cli-window">Command-line Interface subwindows</a>.)
                                              </p>

                                              <p><i>vice</i> provides a number of facilities that make it possible to work efficiently with the keyboard.
                                                For starters, the usual text editing keys are available&mdash;the left and right arrows move the cursor,
                                                the backspace and delete keys delete text, and the home and end keys jump to the start of the line and the end of the line, respectively.
                                                The up and down arrow keys go through the command history; if a recent command should be reissued, or should be reissued with a small change, it may be more efficient to find it in the history and to edit it rather than typing it in from scratch.
                                                </p>

                                              <p>As you read the documentation below and explore <i>vice</i>'s command-line interface, remember that the "help" command is always available.
                                                Running "help" by itself lists all of the available commands.
                                                Running "help" with the name of a command provides a reminder about what that command does and how it is used.
                                                </p>

				       <h2 class="section-heading">Selecting Aircraft</h2>

                                              <p>A key concept for working with the CLI is the <b>currently-selected aircraft</b>.
                                                Clicking on an aircraft's track or datablock in a radar scope selects it, and entering an aircraft's callsign in the CLI causes it to become the currently-selected aircraft.
                                                The currently-selected aircraft is indicated with a distinct color for its datablock in radar scopes and by its callsign being shown in the CLI prompt. For example, AAL1575 is the selected aircraft below:
<div class="text-center">
<img src="assets/vice/selected-aircraft.png" srcset="assets/vice/selected-aircraft-2x.png 2x" width="713" height="53">
</div>
                                              </p>
                                              <p>
                                                For all of the commands that operate on aircraft, the currently-selected aircraft is used by default, unless another aircraft is specified explicitly.
                                              </p>

                                              <p>The currently-selected aircraft can be changed simply by selecting another aircraft.
                                                Alternatively, the currently-selected aircraft can be cleared either by clicking on a radar scope away from any aircraft or by pressing the "escape" key.
                                              </p>

                                       <p>Another way to specify aircraft for commands is to start entering a command and then click on an aircraft in a radar scope.
                                         That aircraft's callsign will be automatically added to the command being entered.
                                         </p>

                                              <p>In order to make it easier to select aircraft using the command-line, <i>vice</i> allows entering a partial callsign.
                                                If the given callsign is unambiguous, then the corresponding aircraft is selected, but if multiple aircraft match, an error is issued.
                                                In the example below, the "SWA" callsign alone is insufficient, but typing "SWA2" and hitting enter is enough to select SWA2783.
                                                In this case, the aircraft might alternatively have been seleced by entering a partial callsign like "783".
<div class="text-center">
<img src="assets/vice/select-aircraft-completion.gif" srcset="assets/vice/select-aircraft-completion-2x.gif 2x" width="715" height="94" class="img-fluid">
</div>
Note also that it is not necessarily to capitalize the letters in callsigns.
                                              </p>

                                              <p>If you have entered a partial callsign, pressing the "tab" key will cause <i>vice</i> to attempt to replace your text with the full callsign.
                                                However, if multiple callsigns match, it will print a message below the text entry field, showing the matches.
                                                Seeing the options in that way makes it easy to see how to make the callsign unambiguous.
                                                In the sample below, hitting tab after typing "AAL1" is insufficient to select the desired aircraft but after seeing the error message, we see that adding a "6" to make "AAL16" and then typing tab works to select AAL1610.

                                                      causes the reported altitude clearance in the flight plan window to change, it has no actual effect.</p>

                                                  Some change individual aspects of an aircraft's flight plan and others provide information that is useful
                                                  when clearing an aircraft.
                                                  It is a good idea to have a <a href="#flight-plan">Flight Plan subwindow</a> visible as part of your Config so that you can easily check an aircraft's current flight plan and see the effect of changes you make to it as you are clearing it.

                                                  All of these commands use the currently-selected aircraft, if there is one.
                                                  For example, if UAL955 is selected, then its type can be set simply by typing <code>actype B772/G</code>;
                                                  there is no need to specify the callsign.

                                                <p>
                                                  The altitude specified with the <code>alt</code> command may either be a full altitude, or may be a three digit altitude, in which case it is interpreted as being hundreds of feet.  Thus, either "31000" and "310" could be provided to specify FL310.
                                                  </p>

                                                <p>If only a minor modification to the route is necessary, then it's undesirable to  have to reenter all of it using the <code>route</code> command.
                                                  For such cases, the <code>editroute</code> command is available.
                                                  It loads the specified aircraft's route into the command-line input, ready to be directly edited.
                                                  After you correct it, hitting enter causes the <code>route</code> command to be executed.

                                         One of the goals of <i>vice</i> is to make it easy to access the additional information that is useful
                                         when controlling.
                                         While experienced controllers may have little need for these functions, they are intended to be helpful for
                                         new controllers as they are learning how to contraol aircraft in VATSIM.

                                                  Further, as before, aircraft callsigns may be abbreviated when the abbreviation is unambiguous.
                                                  Finally, as with the <code>alt</code> command, the altitude specified with <code>tempalt</code> may either be in feet or in hundreds of feet.

                                                  For the commands that take a controller, the controller may either be specified via a callsign (e.g., <code>JFK_APP</code>), or using the identifier for the position (e.g., <code>6e</code>).
                                                  </p>

                                                  Finally, a number of the commands from the <a href="#clearance-delivery">Clearance Delivery</a> section are useful for
                                                  enroute controlling&mdash;<code>squawk</code> and <code>scratchpad</code> especially, though the others are also useful for pop-up clearances.

                                                  <li> For Euroscope, open or create the file <code>myipaddr.txt</code> in <code>Documents/Euroscope</code>. Add a line to the file containing <code>127.0.0.1 vsniff</code>.</li>
                                                </ol>
                                                <p>Then, each time you want to record a controlling session, do the following:</p>
                                                <ol>
                                                  <li> Launch <i>vsniff</i>.</li>
                                                  <li> Choose "vsniff" as your server when you establish a connection in VRC/Euroscope.</li>
                                                  <li> Control as usual.  As your session progresses, a file named along the lines of <code>2022-09-15@121005.vess</code> will be written storing the network traffic. (The filename encodes the date and time at which the session began.)
</li>
                                                  <p>To replay a recorded session file in <i>vice</i>, choose the "VATSIM Replay" connection type. You will be prompted to locate a VATSIM session file.  After doing so, you will be offered the opportunity to speed up or slow down the rate at which the session is replayed and to select an offset into the session in seconds.
                                                    </p>
