	    <section class="docs-intro">
	      <p><i>Vice</i> is a new (potential) client for <a href="https://vatsim.net">VATSIM</a>, the virtual online aviation network.
                It is an all-new client implementation, features support for both Windows and Mac computers, and offers a wide range of
                useful features for virtual air traffic control.</p>
              <p>
                At the moment <i>vice</i> is best described as a fairly-complete prototype; although it supports the vast majority of features
                necessary for a control client, it is still missing a few features&mdash;an example is flight strips, which haven't
                yet been implemented.  More significantly, <i>vice</i> is not yet able to connect to the VATSIM network; even if it
                was fully-featured, it cannot be used for ATC until it can connect to VATSIM! (This is a state of affairs that I
                hope will change in the future.) Nevertheless, it's possible to give <i>vice</i> a try, using air traffic from
                <a href="https://www.flightradar24.com">Flightradar24</a> or by capturing the network traffic from a VATSIM session;
                this topic is discussed further in <a href="#traffic">Traffic Sources</a>.
              </p>
	    </section><!--//docs-intro-->
	  </header>

	  <section class="docs-section" id="goals">
	    <h2 class="section-heading">Goals</h2>

	    <p>It's fair to ask, why another VATSIM client? The <i>vice</i> project started out of curiosity with an interest
              in trying out some new ideas for how a client might work.
              I asked myself "how hard could it be?", and as always seems to be the case, the answer to that question was "much harder
              than it seemed at first."
              Nevertheless, once you get far enough with something like this, your choice is to finish it or throw it away, incomplete.
              Not wanting to the effort to go to waste, I went with finishing it.
            </p>
            <p>A few further motivations became clear as I made progress.  The first was <b>cross-platform support</b>: the ability to use VATSIM on non-Windows computers (both Macs and Linux) is of interest to many; <i>vice</i> was therefore written to be cross-platform from the start.
              The next was that it be <b>open source</b>: the source code to <i>vice</i> is freely available; my hope is that it will see further improvements thanks to the contributions of additional developers.
            </p>
            <p>In its current form, <i>vice</i> does not strive to replicate the experience of using a particular real-world ATC system.
              Rather, its goal is to be general-purpose and to be suited to VATSIM's unique top-down control structure, where a controller may be simultaneously responsible for a range of positions.
              An interesting future project would be to add modes that better replicate specific real-world systems; much of the core of <i>vice</i>'s implementation could be reused for such an effort, making it easier to develop such support. 
            </p>

          <section class="docs-section" id="credits">
            <h2 class="section-heading">Credits</h2>

            <p><i>vice</i> uses a number of open-source libraries in its implementation; see the <a href="https://github.com/mmp/vice/blob/master/CREDITS.txt">credits file</a> in the 
source code distribution for details.
              Thanks also to the font and audio designers whose freely-available work is used in <i>vice</i>; they, too, are listed in the credits file.
              Finally, thanks to our AI overlord <a href="https://openai.com/dall-e-2/">DALL-E 2</a>, who created <i>vice</i>'s icon given the prompt "air traffic control tower retro art deco".
            </p>
            <p><i>vice</i> is heavily influenced by Ross Carlson's <a href="https://vrc.rosscarlson.dev">VRC</a> client for VATSIM; many features from VRC have been reimplemented in <i>vice</i>.
              Thanks to Ross for many happy hours with VRC as well as the inspiration for those features.

            <h2 class="section-heading">Reporting Bugs</h2>

            <p>As a new client, <i>vice</i> will inevitably have bugs. If you have encountered one, apologies!
              It would be of great help if you would send in a report if <i>vice</i> crashes when you're using it,
              reports an error that it cannot recover from, or even if it is doing something that doesn't seem quite
              right.
            </p>
            <p>Bugs can be reported via email at <i>bugs@vice.pharr.org</i>. In your bug report, please include:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>A description of what you were doing and how <i>vice</i> responded. If what it's drawing on the
                  screen is garbled or otherwise incorrect, including a screenshot would be helpful, if you're able.</li>
                <li><i>Vice</i>'s log files from your controlling session; after you exit <i>Vice</i>, it will save a log
                  file for your session. On Windows, it's in your <code>AppData</code> folder in <code>Roaming/Vice/vice.log</code> and on Mac, it's in <code>Library/Application Support/Vice/vice.log</code>. Attaching that file to a bug report will greatly help with fixing the issue. Note that this file is overwritten each time you quit <i>vice</i>, so be sure not restart <i>vice</i> before attaching it to a bug report and sending the email. </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
              If you happen to have a github account, bugs can also be reported in the <i>vice</i> <a href="https://github.com/mmp/vice/issues">issue tracker</a> there, but there is no need to make a github account to report a bug if you don't already have one.
            </p>
            <p>Also, if you find any errors or omissions in this documentation, please email <i>bugs@vice.pharr.org</i>.
              (Similarly, if you have a github account, there's the <a href="https://github.com/mmp/vice-website">issue tracker for the website contents</a>.

          <section class="docs-section" id="configs">
            <h2 class="section-heading">Configs</h2>

            <p>One of the key concepts in <i>vice</i> is the <b>Config</b>.
              A Config represents an organization of the <i>vice</i> window&ndash;the radar scopes that are available and their settings, and the additional tools that are present.
              (In the next section, <a href="#subwindows">Subwindows</a>, we will go into much detail about the items that can be placed in the <i>vice</i> window.)</p>
            <p>
              One might typically have a separate config for each position that one controls&ndash;one for JFK_GND and another for JFK_TWR, for example.
              The Config gives a convenient way to organize all of the <i>vice</i> settings that one might want to change when controlling different positions.
              As an example, here is a config that's a reasonable one for JFK_TWR.
              Most of the window is devoted to the tower's radar scope.
              To the left is various information about the weather at JFK, the departures, arrivals, and the other online controllers.
              Going across the bottom of the window, we have a radar scope for ground control, a place for entering commands with the keyboard, and a subwindow that shows the flight plan ofr the currently selected aircraft, JBU917.
            </p>

              (You're encouraged to make it full-screen.)
              That window is then split into <i>subwindows</i>, where each subwindow has a tool associated with it.
              We saw this idea above, with the Config for controlling JFK_TWR that had two radar scopes, a command-line interface section, and various other information displayed on the screen.
            </p>
            <p>With this approach, there's no need to worry about organizing multiple windows on your screen and having to deal with things being covered up when they overlap.
              Every pixel in the <i>vice</i> window is associated with exactly one subwindow and thus, exactly one tool.
            </p>
            <p><i>vice</i> imposes very few restrictions about how you configure your subwindows.
              If you were only doing clearance delivery, for example, you might not even have a radar scope visible but would instead just have flight plans and airport information available to you.
              Or if you were using <i>vice</i> to watch live traffic for entertainment, you might not have a command-line interface subwindow since you have no aircraft under your control.
              However, most of the time you will have at least one radar scope, the command-line interface, a flight plan subwindow and an airport information subwindow.
            </p>
            <p>Select the "Subwindows" main menu item to configure the subwindows in your Config.
              Each one will have an entry in the menu.

            <h3 class="section-heading">Editing the Layout</h3>

            <p>When you first launch <i>vice</i>, you will be presented with a default Config with a few commonly-used subwindows.
              You can then edit that Config to your liking, or you can create a new Config from scratch.
              Here we will walk through how one organizes a brand-new Config, though the same ideas apply to editing an existing one.
            </p>
            <p>To start we have a window with a single radar scope.
              It is showing video maps for KJFK, KLGA, and KEWR, which are all close to each other.
              Let's assume we were responsible for all three airports and wanted a config where we could keep an eye on the ground at each of them.
              We'd like to have three scopes along the left, one for each of the airports, and then a place to enter keyboard commands at the bottom.
            </p>
            <p>We'll start by splitting up the window into subwindows.
              Select the "Configs/Edit Layout..." menu item and a few controls appear at the top of the window.
              We'll start by splitting the window in half horizontally.
              After clicking the "Split Horizontally" button, we click in the main window to select it to be split.
              Then we choose "Split Vertically" and click the main radar scope to make room at the bottom for the command line.
              Two more selections of "Split Vertically", now splitting the left side of the window, make room for the per-airport scopes.
            </p>
            <div class="text-center">
              <img src="assets/vice/editor-initial-split.gif" srcset="assets/vice/editor-initial-split-2x.gif 2x" width="849" height="536" class="img-fluid">
            </div>
            <p>Next we'll adjust the sizes of the subwindows, giving the main scope most of the window area and giving the three airports
              equal space on the left side.
              Just place the mouse cursor over the gray lines at the subwindow boundaries, click the right mouse button, and drag to size them as you like.
            </p>

            </div>
            <p>Now we have a bunch of empty subwindows.
              The "Create new..." option lets us give each one a job.
              After choosing a type of subwindow, we click on the region of the window where it should go.
              We'll have the bottom right one take care of the command-line interface and then create new radar scopes for the three on the left.
              All three start out with a default view.
            </p>
            <div class="text-center">
              <img src="assets/vice/editor-assign-subwindows.gif" srcset="assets/vice/editor-assign-subwindows-2x.gif 2x" width="849" height="536" class="img-fluid">
            </div>
            <p>Finally the three new radar scopes need to be set up.
              We'll just show KLGA here.
              There's an entry in the "Subwindows" menu for each subwindow on the screen; selecting it brings up the subwindows configuration window.
              We'll take one of the Unnamed ones.
              First we give it a more descriptive name; you can see that the main window is updated to show the name we've entered.
              Right clicking and dragging then lets us center the radar scope on the airport.
              The mouse wheel lets us zoom in so it fits the subwindow.
              It's a little busy with all of the taxiway and runway labels, so we'll go back to the KLGA configuration subwindow to turn those off.</p>

            <p>Even outside of the Config editor, it's easy to change the size of subwindows: just right-click on the lines that separate them and drag them.
              In this way you can fine-tune the size of your subwindows to achieve a layout that works for you.

            <br>
            <p>It's also possible to select a subwindow to temporarily take over the entire <i>vice</i> window.
              Hover your mouse over the subwindow you'd like to enlarge and hit control-f.
              When you're ready to go back to the original view, hit control-f again.
              This feature makes it possible to have very small radar scopes when doing top-down control on VATSIM, like the ground radar in the earlier JFK_TWR example.
              Sometimes you may be able to do ground control from the small subwindow, but if you need a closer view, one is easily at hand.

            <p>Radar scopes are at the heart of any virtual ATC client, <i>vice</i> included.
              A radar scope must clearly show important information to the controller, accurately rendered, while not distracting them with unnecessary information.
              What is important and what is not depends both on the position being controlled and the individual controller, so <i>vice</i> offers a highly-configurable radar scope so that each user can set their radar scopes up it in the way that is most useful to them.

            <p>The mouse can be used to do a number of things in a radar scope.
              Left clicking on an aircraft's track or datablock selects it, and left-clicking away from any aircraft deselects the currently-selected aircraft.
              The flight plan of the currently-selected aircraft is displayed in the <a href="#flight-plan">flight plan subwindow</a>.
              The currently-selected aircraft is also extensively used by commands in <i>vice</i>'s <a href="#section-cli">command-line interface</a>.
            </p>
            <p>Left clicking and dragging a datablock repositions it.
            </p>
            <p>Double-left-clicking and dragging from one point to another shows an indicator that gives both the distance between the two points in nm as well as the heading and reciprocal heading between them.

            <p>The settings window for radar scopes offers numerous configurable options.
              When first opened, most of them are hidden under subheadings.
              Of the visible ones, the first allows the scope's name can be specified.
              The scope name is shown in its upper-left corner and is used to distinguish between scopes in the "Subwindows" menu.
              A range of altitudes can be specified as well.
              Any aircraft outside of this range are not shown on the scope.
            </p>
            <div class="text-center">
              <img src="assets/vice/radar-settings.png" srcset="assets/vice/radar-settings-2x.png 2x" width="396" height="230">
            </div>

            <p>The first subheading offers options for configuring how aircraft are shown.
              A number of data block formats are available, with varying amount of information available.
              The current selections, "none", "simple", "ground", "tower", and "full" generally correspond to the data block formats offered by VRC.
              If "Vector lines" is selected, the user can configure the length of a vector line in front of aircraft.
              It may be specified either as a fixed number of nautical miles or as the estimated distance the aircraft will travel in the specified number of minutes.
              Finally, there is an experimental feature, "Automatic datablock layout", which tries to move overlapping datablocks so that they no longer overlap.
              When it works, it a handy feature, though it is still a work in progress; it causes data blocks to jump all over the place when there are too many of them.

            </div>

            <p>The next subheading makes it possible to control the appearance of the radar scope.
              Fonts and line widths can be set, and the scope can be rotated; this can be especially useful for ground control where having North exactly up may be less important than reducing the space the airport takes on the radar scope by rotating it accordingly.

            <p>The third subheading, Tools, offers a number of useful tools to enable in radar scopes.

            <p>Finally, the Scope Contents heading allows control over drawing all of the objects that are defined in the sector file.
              In addition to all of the fixed types of objects&ndash;VORs, airways, etc.&ndash;it also allows selecting objects like video

              If no aircraft is selected, the directions are with respect to the center of the scope, but if an aircraft is selected,
              they are with respect to the aircraft's position, as shown in the example below.

              It is possible to configure the radar scope to both issue early warnings at a greater distance and to
              issue alerts when a violation occurs.
              The criteria for these can each be set individually for pairs of IFR/IFR aircraft, IFR/VFR, and VFR/VFR, depending on the
              airspace being controlled.
              Furthermore, situations between aircraft can be shown both with classic range rings as well as with a line between them, depending on the controller's preference.

            <p>The radar scope can also show the miles in trail (MIT) between aircraft in an approach sequence.
              The sequence can specified directly using the <a href="#managing-information"><code>mit</code></a> command.
              Alternatively, <i>vice</i> has an experimental feature where it tries to infer the landing sequence based on the positions of
              aircraft arriving at an airport and draw MIT indicators automatically.
              This feature is enabled with the "Automatic MIT lines for arrivals" option in the "Tools" submenu of the radar settings window.
            </p>
            <p>Here is an example, with the arrival sequence SKY1548, B1350, SWA542, and DAL26550.
              For each pair, both their current distance and their predicted distance 30 seconds in the future are reported.
              The predicted distance accounts for the respective speeds and headings of both aircraft.

            <p>The Converging Runway Display Aid tool draws "ghost" aircraft in the arrival sequence of converging runways,
              so that a controller can sequence the two runways properly.
              It is based on a tool in the real-world STARS system, which is also replicated in vSTARS.
            </p>
            <p>
              If this option is selected in the radar scope settings, many additional controls appear.
              First, it is necessary to specify the airport of interest so that <i>vice</i> can determine its runways.
              Next, a primary and secondary runway are specified, indicating the two converging runways in use.
              By default, the ghost aircraft are drawn in the secondary runway's sequence, though an option allows having them in the primary runway's.
              The "stagger" mode draws the ghost the same distance from the intersection point of the two runways along the secondary
              approach, while "tie" offsets the aircraft by a specified distance.
              With "stagger" mode, one sequences as if the ghost was where it appears, while with "tie", one attempts to have aircraft on the secondary approach overlap the ghost aircraft.
              A number of additional options control how <i>vice</i> decides if an aircraft is on approach for the primary runway.
              Hopefully, they can be left alone.

              We have FFT1462 on final approach for runway 9R while EJA730 is on final for runway 35.
              Runway 9R has been designated the primary runway, so the secondary runway, 35, has a ghost of FFT1462 in the sequence.

            <p>The Airport Information subwindow can be used to display a variety of information about one or more airports.
              Which airports are included in an Airport Information subwindow can be entered in its settings window.
              Thus, if you're controlling multiple airports, you might have all of them represented in a single Aircraft Information subwindow,
              or you might have multiple subwindows, one for each airport.
            </p>
            <p>Here is an example of its contents:</p>
            <div class="text-center">
              <img src="assets/vice/airport-info-full.png" srcset="assets/vice/airport-info-full-2x.png 2x" width="512" height="577">
            </div>
            <p>
              There's a lot of text there, but what is there is carefully selected and is organized to be easily accessible by the controller.
              Not all of these things need to be displayed; which of them are there can be configured via the Airport Information subwindow's settings window.
              Thus, if you're a tower controller and someone else is doing clearance delivery, you might not include information
              about the uncleared aircraft.
            </p>
            <p>At the top is the current time and the METAR and ATIS for the selected airport or airports.
              The altimeter and winds are highlighted, for ease of finding them quickly.
            </p>
            <p>Aircraft that have not yet received their clearance are shown next.
              Basic information about each one's flight plan is shown in the display, including the flight rules, departure and arrival airports,
              aircraft type, and cruising altitude.
              The second line shows the aircraft's filed route.
              This way, it's easy to quickly see if a flight plan has problems when a pilot first connects.
              ("Uncleared" is currently determined using the heuristic that aircraft without assigned squawk codes are assumed to be uncleared.)
            </p>
            <p>Aircraft that have been cleared but have not yet departed are listed under "Departures".
              The information included is tailored to the needs of ground and tower controllers.
              From left to right are the callsign, flight rules, departure airport, aircraft type, scratchpad, cleared altitude, and the start of their route.
              In the above example, the last two aircraft have a "sq:[C]" indicator, which indicates that they are not yet squawking mode Charlie.
              The last one is not yet squawking its assigned code, which is shown as well.
            </p>
            <p>Aircraft that have left the airport and are in the air are shown under "Departed".
              Their first six fields match the order of the fields for departures and the last one shows the aircraft's current altitude.
              We can see that the first aircraft has an empty scratchpad while the second has "DIT" in its scratchpad.
            </p>
            <p>Next are arrivals.
              Again the information shown follows the same basic order.
              If a temporary altitude has been set, it is shown in place of the cruising altitude&mdash;here we have FDX2364 with a temporary altitude of 6,000 feet.
              Arrivals also have their distance to the airport shown.
              When there are multiple arrivals, they are not sorted strictly by their distance to the airport; an aircraft 10,000 feet directly above the field may be assumed to be arriving later than one 6nm away at 2,000 feet.
              The sorting of arrivals attempts to display them in the order in which they will reach the airport, given these considerations. 
            </p>
            <p>Finally, the active controllers are listed. In addition to the positions and radio frequencies, the sector id is displayed for each position if it is available.
              Furthermore, the character used to identify aircraft tracked by the controller on radar scopes is shown, again if it is known.
            </p>

            <h3 class="section-heading">Flight Plan</h3>

            <p>There's not much to say about the flight plan subwindow, though it's an invaluable tool; it shows the flight plan for whichever aircraft is currently selected.
              (See further <a href="#selecting-aircraft">discussion of selecting aircraft</a> for more information on aircraft selection.)
              The flight plan can't be edited in the flight plan subwindow; that is handled using <i>vice's</i> command-line interface, which offers a

              see <a href="#managing-information">that documentation</a> for information about the relevant commands.
              For timers, the time until the timer expires is shown.

            <p>The notes viewer subwindow can be used to display text notes written using the <a href="#notes">Notes Editor</a>.
              One or more notes can be selected in the Notes Viewer settings and then each note can be individually selected.
              Notes can be reordered by dragging entries in the list of notes.
              In the example below, the Notes Viewer is displaying the missed approach headings and altitudes for the KJFK runways as well as the takeoff headings for runway 13 in the non-13L ILS configuration.
              From its configuration dialog box on the right, we can see that the headings for runway 13 with 13L ILS are at hand but are not displayed; in this way it's possible to have a number of possibly-relevant quickly available but not necessarily dispayed.
            </p>

            In addition to displaying multiple notes in a single Notes Viewer, it can also be useful to have multiple Notes Viewer subwindows, each displaying different information.

                  <p><i>Vice</i> does not yet support alias files or binding function keys to commands;
                    that functionality will come in a future release.
                    Therefore, it may seem that using the command-line interface will be unwieldy and will require much typing.
                    User-configurable aliases and function key bindings will greatly reduce the typing load,
                    making it easy to use familiar bindings like selecting an aircraft and hitting F3 to initiate a track.

                </div><!--//content-->
              </div><!--//callout-block-->

              <p>Most of a controller's actions controlling aircraft in <i>vice</i> are done via typing commands;
                the mouse is usually only used for interacting with the scope and selecting aircraft.
                A <i>vice</i> Config will almost always include a Command-line Interface (CLI) subwindow, which allows entering commands
                and seeing their results.
                (Recall the earlier discussion of <a href="#cli-window">Command-line Interface subwindows</a>.)
              </p>

              <p><i>vice</i> provides a number of facilities that make it possible to work efficiently with the keyboard.
                For starters, the usual text editing keys are available&mdash;the left and right arrows move the cursor,
                the backspace and delete keys delete text, and the home and end keys jump to the start of the line and the end of the line, respectively.
                The up and down arrow keys go through the command history; if a recent command should be reissued, or should be reissued with a small change, it may be more efficient to find it in the history and to edit it rather than typing it in from scratch.
              </p>

              <p>As you read the documentation below and explore <i>vice</i>'s command-line interface, remember that the "help" command is always available.
                Running "help" by itself lists all of the available commands.
                Running "help" with the name of a command provides a reminder about what that command does and how it is used.

            <h2 class="section-heading">Selecting Aircraft</h2>

            <p>A key concept for working with the CLI is the <b>currently-selected aircraft</b>.
              Clicking on an aircraft's track or datablock in a radar scope selects it, and entering an aircraft's callsign in the CLI causes it to become the currently-selected aircraft.
              The currently-selected aircraft is indicated with a distinct color for its datablock in radar scopes and by its callsign being shown in the CLI prompt. For example, AAL1575 is the selected aircraft below:
            </p>
            <div class="text-center">
              <img src="assets/vice/selected-aircraft.png" srcset="assets/vice/selected-aircraft-2x.png 2x" width="713" height="53">
            </div>
            <p>
              For all of the commands that operate on aircraft, the currently-selected aircraft is used by default, unless another aircraft is specified explicitly.
            </p>

            <p>The currently-selected aircraft can be changed simply by selecting another aircraft.
              Alternatively, the currently-selected aircraft can be cleared either by clicking on a radar scope away from any aircraft or by pressing the "escape" key.
            </p>

            <p>Another way to specify aircraft for commands is to start entering a command and then click on an aircraft in a radar scope.
              That aircraft's callsign will be automatically added to the command being entered.
            </p>

            <p>In order to make it easier to select aircraft using the command-line, <i>vice</i> allows entering a partial callsign.
              If the given callsign is unambiguous, then the corresponding aircraft is selected, but if multiple aircraft match, an error is issued.
              In the example below, the "SWA" callsign alone is insufficient, but typing "SWA2" and hitting enter is enough to select SWA2783.
              In this case, the aircraft might alternatively have been selected by entering a partial callsign like "783".</p>
              <div class="text-center">
                <img src="assets/vice/select-aircraft-completion.gif" srcset="assets/vice/select-aircraft-completion-2x.gif 2x" width="715" height="94" class="img-fluid">
              </div>
              <p>
              Note also that it is not necessarily to capitalize the letters in callsigns.
            </p>

            <p>If you have entered a partial callsign, pressing the "tab" key will cause <i>vice</i> to attempt to replace your text with the full callsign.
              However, if multiple callsigns match, it will print a message below the text entry field, showing the matches.
              Seeing the options in that way makes it easy to see how to make the callsign unambiguous.
              In the sample below, hitting tab after typing "AAL1" is insufficient to select the desired aircraft but after seeing the error message, we see that adding a "6" to make "AAL16" and then typing tab works to select AAL1610. </p>

	        </h4>
                <p>Remember that <i>vice</i> does not connect to VATSIM. Thus, although doing things like changing the cleared altitude of an aircraft
                  causes the reported altitude clearance in the flight plan window to change, it has no actual effect.</p>
              </div><!--//content-->
            </div><!--//callout-block-->

            <p>A variety of commands are available for clearance delivery when using <i>vice</i>'s command-line interface.
              Some change individual aspects of an aircraft's flight plan and others provide information that is useful
              when clearing an aircraft.
              It is a good idea to have a <a href="#flight-plan">Flight Plan subwindow</a> visible as part of your Config so that you can easily check an aircraft's current flight plan and see the effect of changes you make to it as you are clearing it.
            </p>
            
            <p>The following commands modify components of a flight plan:</p>

              All of these commands use the currently-selected aircraft, if there is one.
              For example, if UAL955 is selected, then its type can be set simply by typing <code>actype B772/G</code>;
              there is no need to specify the callsign.
            </p>
            <p>
              The altitude specified with the <code>alt</code> command may either be a full altitude, or may be a three digit altitude, in which case it is interpreted as being hundreds of feet.  Thus, either "31000" and "310" could be provided to specify FL310.
            </p>

            <p>If only a minor modification to the route is necessary, then it's undesirable to  have to reenter all of it using the <code>route</code> command.
              For such cases, the <code>editroute</code> command is available.
              It loads the specified aircraft's route into the command-line input, ready to be directly edited.
              After you correct it, hitting enter causes the <code>route</code> command to be executed.</p>

              While experienced controllers may have little need for these functions, they are intended to be helpful for

              For the commands that take a controller, the controller may either be specified via a callsign (e.g., <code>JFK_APP</code>), or using the identifier for the position (e.g., <code>6e</code>).

            <p>Selecting "Flight Radar" establishes a direct connect with <a href="https://flightradar24.com">Flightradar</a>; <i>vice</i> will display traffic in a 50nm radius from the center of the radar scope.
              Note that only limited information is available for each aircraft&mdash;just the callsign, altitude, and ground speed.
              No further information (e.g., the squawk code, departure and arrival airports, or flight plan) is available.
              The main advantage of this option is that it is a simple way to fill the scopes with realistic air traffic.

            <h2 class="section-heading">Recorded VATSIM Sessions</h2>

            <p>The most complete option is to record the network traffic a VATSIM session when using another client (e.g., VRC).
              That recorded traffic can then be replayed in <i>vice</i>,  which makes it possible to see how that session would have appeared in <i>vice</i>.
              Do the following to prepare to record VATSIM sessions for <i>vice</i>:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li> Install the <i>vsniff</i> utility from its <a href="https://github.com/mmp/vsniff/releases/latest">releases page</a>; binaries for both Windows and OSX are available.</li>
              <li> If you're using VRC, open or create the file <code>myservers.txt</code> in <code>Documents/VRC</code>. Add a line to the file containing: <code>127.0.0.1 vsniff</code>.</li>
              <li> For Euroscope, open or create the file <code>myipaddr.txt</code> in <code>Documents/Euroscope</code>. Add a line to the file containing <code>127.0.0.1 vsniff</code>.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Then, each time you want to record a controlling session, do the following:</p>
            <ol>

              <li> Choose "vsniff" as your server when you establish a connection in VRC/Euroscope.</li>
              <li> Control as usual.  As your session progresses, a file named along the lines of <code>2022-09-15@121005.vess</code> will be written storing the network traffic. (The filename encodes the date and time at which the session began.)</li>

              <p>To replay a recorded session file in <i>vice</i>, choose the "VATSIM Replay" connection type. You will be prompted to locate a VATSIM session file.  After doing so, you will be offered the opportunity to speed up or slow down the rate at which the session is replayed and to select an offset into the session in seconds.
